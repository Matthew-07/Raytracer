# Raytracer
A simple, CPU ray tracer programmed in C++.
Multithreading implemented through the "#pragma omp parallel for" macro

This was based off of a similar program written in Java we had to modify in our first year graphics course.
I wrote this in just a couple of days and it was not meant to be a fully featured ray tracer. It supports shadows, depth of field and area lights.
The code to read XML files was rushed since I just wanted to be able to open the XML files we used for the Java raytracer, partly so I could render them faster than through the java program.
